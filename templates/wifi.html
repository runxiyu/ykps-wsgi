		This article describes configuring the Songjiang Campus's student WiFi network, STUWIRELESS.

			<h2>Talk to the IT</h2>
			<p>If you have new devices, you must contact the IT and have them record your permanent MAC address and username. They will assign you a fixed IPv4 address on the DHCP server.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>NetworkManager for Linux-based systems</h2>
			<p>Add the following to <code>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ykps.nmconnection</code></p>
			<pre>[connection]
id=YKPS
# Any user-friendly name will do
uuid=980c8380-18e5-4dca-b4ef-f8f8378e9994
# Random UUID, just make sure it doesn't collide
type=wifi

[wifi]
cloned-mac-address=permanent              
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/StableSSIDMACAddress
mac-address-randomization=1
# 1 = "never"
mode=infrastructure
ssid=STUWIRELESS

[wifi-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap

[802-1x]
# Technically it would be more secure against evil-twin attacks if we
# pinned certificates but I don't want to bother getting a
# certificate because our IT doesn't provide one.  Welp.
anonymous-identity=student@ykpaoschool.cn
# Don't change anonymous-identity
eap=peap;
identity=username
#   e.g. s22537
password=password
#   e.g. supersecretpassword
phase1-auth-flags=32
# Allow insecure TLS 1.0 (used by stuff like eduroam and STUWIRELESS)
phase2-auth=mschapv2

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=default
method=auto</pre>
			<p>
			Remember to set the file ownership to <code>root:root</code> and permissions to <code>0600</code>. Also remember that comments must begin at the start of the line. See <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/nm-settings-keyfile.5"><code>nm-settings-keyfile(5)</code></a> for details.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then you should be able to just reload the NetworkManager service, and connect with <code>nmcli connection up YKPS</code> or whatever utility your desktop environment provides.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you wish to manually use <code>wpa_supplicant</code>, in additional to the "standard" configuration, you need to add <code>tls_disable_tlsv1_0=0</code> to the <code>phase1</code> flags. This corresponds to <code>phase1-auth-flags=32</code> in the NetworkManager configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you wish to use a static IP, replace the <code>[ipv4]</code> block with the following and modify <code>XXX</code> to fit your assigned IPv4 address:
			</p>
			<pre>[ipv4]
address1=10.2.XXX.XXX/21,10.2.191.253
dns=10.2.20.101;10.2.20.100;10.2.120.21;
dns-search=ykpaoschool.cn;
may-fail=false
method=manual</pre>
			<p>
			You still need to use the network authentication portal. <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu/tooch/tree/master/sjauth">A simple C program</a> is available to automate this process that only depends on <code>libcurl</code>; you may want to run this every 6 AM and at power-on if 6 AM was missed, for example, via <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/anacron/anacron.8.en.html"><code>anacron(8)</code></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Note that TCP and UDP port 53 (usually used for DNS) is unblocked at all times and can accept arbitrary traffic, which still works if it's past 22:30, or even if you're not logged in. Therefore, if you have a server in Mainland China that, for example, listens on port 53 for IPSec/L2TP/WireGuard/<a href="https://code.kryo.se/iodine/">iodine</a>, the network authentication portal and the night-time block can be bypassed entirely. (Doing so with a server outside of Mainland China will result in blockage.)

			<h2>macOS</h2>
			<p>
			Connect to the "STUWIRELESS" network with your normal school credentials.
			</p>
			<p>
			Every morning (after 6 AM), you must log in at the network captive portal at <a href="https://sjauth.ykpaoschool.cn:444/"><code>https://sjauth.ykpaoschool.cn:444/</code></a>.

			<h2>iPadOS</h2>
			<p>
			Be sure that "Private WLAN Address" is disabled in the "STUWIRELESS" network's properties. Then connect to the network with your normal school credentials.
